The dot matrix printer essentially treats the piece of paper as a grid and to each point in the grid prints a dot of ink. If the pixel is to be white, no ink is added (0) and if the pixel is black (1), the maximum amount of ink is added. If the shade is to be intermediate, an intermediate level of ink is added (a float between 0 and 1). Each dot can be translated to a number which represents the level of ink in the dot. A common printing resolution is 600 dpi meaning there are 600 dots per inch on the piece of paper. This translates to a piece of A4 paper merely being treated as a matrix that has 7014 rows and 4962 columns. The product of these scalar values gives 34,803,468 pixels which is abbreviated to ~35 million pixels or 35 mega pixels."
